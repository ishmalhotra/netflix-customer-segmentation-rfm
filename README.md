# 🎯 Netflix Customer Segmentation (RFM Model)

This project demonstrates how Netflix can segment its user base using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) modeling. The goal is to identify user groups like VIPs, Loyal users, At-Risk users, etc., and recommend strategic marketing actions using behavioral data.

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Mockaroo (for dataset simulation)

## 📁 Files Included
- `netflix_rfm_segmentation.ipynb` – Python notebook with full logic
- `netflix_raw_data.csv` – Simulated user behavior data (Mockaroo)
- `netflix_segmented_output.csv` – Final output with RFM score, segment, CLV, NBA
- `/visuals/` – Heatmap, boxplot, sunburst visuals

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Simulated 500+ user profiles
2. Calculated RFM scores with weighted logic
3. Created custom segmentation thresholds
4. Visualized insights using charts
5. Recommended Next Best Actions per segment

## 📊 Key Segments
| Segment   | Description               |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| VIP       | High recency, freq, spend |
| Loyal     | Consistent viewers        |
| At Risk   | Previously active         |
| Inactive  | No recent activity        |
| Average   | Mid-tier behavior         |
